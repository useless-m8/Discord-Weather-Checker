Simple weather discord bot checker made possible with Open Meteo API and reverse geocoding TomTom API. For more accurate results sometimes it's needed to specify the country additional to the city given. 
If successful, the bot gives out current temperature, area covered by rain or showers, cloud coverage, relative humidity and a day/night time check. 
<h3>Example given of a successful response by bot:</h3>
