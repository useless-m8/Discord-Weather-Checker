Simple weather python discord bot made possible with Open-Meteo API and reverse geocoding TomTom API. For more accurate results sometimes it's needed to specify the country additional to the city given. 
If successful, the bot gives out current temperature, area covered by rain or showers, cloud coverage, relative humidity and a day/night time check.

<p>For the bot to work properly you have to get the discord bot token and an API key from https://developer.tomtom.com/.</p>
